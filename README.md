# DBMS_TESTED
This project is a web project for recording traffic violations of riders and drivers by the traffic authority.
Each traffic authority gets his own username and password that is maintained by the MySQL database using a hashing technique.
Similarly riders can view their offences and the system displays the list of all violations the rider has made.
The admin has database access who can add and remove the authorisation for different traffic authorities.

Each page has integrated PHP that connects to the backend which is a MySQL server.
The webpages have been designed using Bootstrap in HTML and CSS along with some low level JavaScript.
This project has not been tested on an official server due to the lack of availabilty but is fully tested and debugged on a localhost.
